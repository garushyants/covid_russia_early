# covid_russia_early

This repository contains R and Python scripts utilized in the manuscript by [Komissarov et al., 2020](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.20150979v1)

All necessary data files required to reproduce the results are provided in the data folder.

Scripts in python are required for tree manipulations and visualization.

*get_lineages_and_dates.py* allows to find all Russian lineages on the tree and visualize them.

*get_singletons.py* and *get_stem_clusters.py* allow to find Russian singletons and stem clusters.

For clade definitions see [Figure 3](https://github.com/garushyants/covid_russia_early/blob/main/Figures/Fig3_lineages_explained.png)

R scripts *Figure1_draw_maps.R* and *Figure6_Lineages_stem_times.R* are required to construct Figures 1 and 6 from the manuscript.
